## Progress Report 2

### Tasks
A lot of the progress made was in adding content to the existing activities and adding the logic behind that content. The new content was all in CharacterSheetActivity, CharacterEquipmentActivity, and CharacterSkillsActivity.

- Darin Beaudreau
    - Added new fields to the CharacterSheetActivity layout and Java file, and added new fields to the CharacterInfo class and logic to the activity to accomodate these new fields.
    - Added save/load feature for saving and loading characters. No interface yet, but the logic is there (although untested).
    - Added fields to CharacterInfo class to accomodate tasks given to Anthony and Ethan.
- Ethan Goldman
    - Created basic layout for content in the CharacterEquipmentActivity and a new activity to add/subtract money from the player's total.
    - Added Coins and Equipment classes for use in the CharacterEquipmentActivity. Coins class works fine, but Equipment class has yet to be used in implementation in the actual activity. This will be in the next update.
- Anthony Rinaldi
    - Added fields in CharacterSkillsActivity for all game skills, as well as buttons to "roll" these skills.
    - Will be adding logic behind the layout in the next update.
