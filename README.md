### Tasks
Most of the tasks have been completed by me, since there are a lot of things I had to get working before tasks could be assigned to the rest of my team, such as the CharacterInfo class, which is still in progress. I've had my other team members working on researching how to implement later features while they wait for me to complete my tasks.

- Darin Beaudreau
-- Created the MainActivity, CreateCharacterActivity, CharacterMainActivity, CharacterSheetActivity, CharacterSpellbookActivity, PreparedSpellsFragment, MySpellbookFragment, FullSpellbookFragment, SpellbookTabAdapter, SpellListAdapter, GlobalState, Preferences, CharacterInfo, CharacterRace, CharacterClass, CharacterAlignment, AbilityScore, DiceRoller, and Spell classes, as well as the related layouts.
- Ethan Goldman
-- Created the CharacterEquipmentActivity class and related layout.
- Anthony Rinaldi
-- Is currently researching how to use the Google Nearby API to find other devices nearby using the app so we can transfer character sheets to other users.
-- Will be creating the CharacterSkillsActivity and related layout when I add the proper members and methods to the CharacterInfo class so he can access them from the activity.
