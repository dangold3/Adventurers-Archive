**Project Proposal:**

Our project will be based around collating information about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, and then making an Android app to present this information to the user in a convenient format so that they have the information easily available on their phone. 

The app will include a “character sheet” of sorts that will allow the user to view and edit their character statistics, and will have tools such as an equipment list, so that the user can keep track of their equipment. We will also implement a “spellbook” so that users can keep track of what spells they have prepared, and which spells they know. 

As for the database requirement, we will be using XML to store our data, as it is easy for Android to read and manipulate. The XML files will mostly include information about spells that will be read into the Spellbook. 

For the networking requirement, our initial idea is to have an initiative tracker where the game master can be the "host" and other players can roll for initiative, which will cause them to appear in the initiative list on everyone else's screens, and then the game master can cycle through the players.

These are the features we have planned now, but we may add more as stretch goals if we finish all the features previously mentioned. 

**Tasks:**
I spoke to you in class about how I am going to be using the same project I am developing for my Software Engineering II class. I spoke to Yu Cao about it, and he agreed, on the condition that the app cannot be the same exact app I submit in his class. He did not have database and networking requirements, so that is the addition I will be making in this app.

I will work on largely the UI and activities and their functionality with the back-end resources.

Anthony and Ethan Goldman will work together to implement the network functionality described above. We are not yet sure how to get the devices to communicate with each other, but if a server is required, I may be able to use my Raspberry Pi to host some sort of communication server. But unless we cover that in class, I am not sure how that will be achieved. I will discuss this with my teammates.
